        <p>
          Ador is a yellow looking cat, and he really enjoys headrubs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adors favorite food is cat food, this is because he is a cat so therefore
          he likes cat fod.

        <h2>Finn</h2>

        <img
          src="images/pets/finn-halloween.jpg"
          alt="Finn wears a bat costume for halloween."
          width="400"
        />

        <p>
          Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I’m just
          gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives
          to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I
          can only describe him as goofy and chaotic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finn’s biggest enemy is his vet. I don’t know whether or not it’s because his vet is an
          MSU alum, but he doesn’t like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he
          goes to the vet office because he’ll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7
          years.

        <p>
          Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit
          enjoys running outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours.
          He also likes going for occasional swims.
        </p>
        <p>
          As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and
          watch Netflix with his owners. His favorite treat is apples.
        </p>

        <h2>Honey</h2>

        <img
          src="images/pets/honey-main.jpeg"
          alt="Honey is a medium-sized golden retriever with honey brown fur. She has a white patch of fur on her chest and her right eye is smaller than her left."
          width="400"
        />

        <p>
          Honey’s favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the middle of January and
          half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my
          brother and I go underwater, she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we
          come up for air.
        </p>
        <p>
          While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase rocks. She will even
          chase rocks into the water and stick her whole face in the water to try and find the rock
          thrown. Chasing rocks is her main form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks
          from our house. If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey will go on a
          walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to walk from home. Finally one
          other Honey-ism is that her safe place is bathtubs. Many times our family has woken up in
          the middle of the night and found Honey is a bathtub.
        </p>

        <h2>Milktea</h2>

        <img src="images/pets/milktea-main.jpg" alt="Milktea taking nap" width="400" />

        <p>
          Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and
          refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of
          any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be
          translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty
          for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder
          intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold
          because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage
          accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even
          walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while
          sacrificing the animals’ health.
